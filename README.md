🎬 Discord Movie Bot
This is a simple Discord bot built to help friends stay connected and entertained during COVID lockdowns. The bot provides basic Create, Read, and Delete functionality to manage a shared list of movies to watch together.

🛠 Features

➕ Add movies to the list

📃 View the full list of saved movies

❌ Remove movies once watched

This was designed for my friend group to easily coordinate movie nights during the pandemic.
Whether you're social distancing or just trying to pick a movie everyone agrees on, this bot helps make remote movie nights easier to organize and more fun.

💡 Why I Made This
During the height of the pandemic, my friends and I struggled to keep track of the movies we wanted to watch together. I created this bot as a lightweight solution to manage our watchlist right within Discord.
